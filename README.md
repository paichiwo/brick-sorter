I have developed it to sort my personal LEGO collection.

## **Special credit**
I'd like to express appreciation of the outstanding work of Akascape, 
which is available at https://github.com/Akascape. The application's dropdown menu,
uses Akascape's CTkScrollableDropdown, 
although it has been customized to better align with our application's requirements.
